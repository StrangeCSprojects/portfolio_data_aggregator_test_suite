# Test Strategy: Portfolio Data Aggregator Test Suite

## Objective
This test suite verifies the reliability, correctness, and structure of a mock API that returns financial portfolio and asset data. The goal is to ensure robust backend test coverage, proper schema validation, and resilience against edge cases.

## Scope
- Functional testing of two key API endpoints:
  - `/api/portfolio`
  - `/api/assets`
- Schema validation using Pydantic
- Status code validation (200, 400, 404)
- Edge case handling: empty data, missing fields, and invalid types
- Test automation using Pytest
- Test coverage tracking using `pytest-cov`

## Out of Scope
- Frontend/UI testing
- Database integration testing
- Authentication/authorization flows

## Test Types
- **Unit Tests**: Validate schema models and isolated test logic.
- **API Tests**: Validate mocked endpoint behavior using `responses`.
- **Edge Case Tests**: Test API behavior with empty portfolios, missing fields, and invalid formats.
- **Coverage Checks**: Use `pytest-cov` to measure test effectiveness.

## Tools & Libraries
- **Python 3.10+**
- **Pytest**: Test runner and framework
- **Responses**: HTTP mocking library for API testing
- **Pydantic**: Schema and data structure validation
- **Pytest-cov**: Coverage reporting
- **Locust** (planned): Performance testing (non-functional)

## CI Integration (Planned)
- Automated test execution on every push or pull request
- Linting and test summary with coverage metrics

## Quality Metrics
- Target 90%+ test coverage for core logic and schema validation
- 100% test pass rate for primary and edge scenarios
- Coverage reports reviewed for untested paths

## Summary
This test strategy supports backend test automation goals by using clean, reusable test patterns, structured schema validation, and early integration with quality metrics and CI compatibility.
